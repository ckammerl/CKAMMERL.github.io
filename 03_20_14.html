			<h1>03/20/14 - Why is JavaScript so popular in web development?</h1>
			<p>To answer that question briefly, here some of its great <strong>features</strong>:<br><br>JavaScript...</p>
			<ul>
				<li>...can be learned in a fairly decent time</li>
				<li>...can directly be added to a web page and it works</li>
				<li>...can be handled by most of today's browsers</li>
			</ul>

			<p>And some of its <strong>benefits</strong>:<br><br>JavaScript...</p>
			<ul>
				<li>...broadly enhances the user experience </li>
				<li>...makes your web page dynamic and interactive</li>
				<li>...helps you to be the one who gets the job</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The overview above is not complete, but covers some key reasons for the popularity of JavaScript. Let me give you a little more information on each of the points listed above.</p>

			<p>In order to use JavaScript, you don't need access to a web server. The client (browser) doesn't need to contact the server to get the right information on what to do (and when) and therefore to allow for interaction. JavaScript can directly be added to a web page and it works.</p>

			<p>Most of today's browsers can handle JavaScript which means your Javascript script will successfully enhance the experience of many users. Plain HTLM pages are static but JavaScript provides user interfaces and makes web pages dynamic.</p>

			<p>As a web developer, it allows you to change web pages at a defined event, for instance the display of a pop up window to ask for a password confirmation when a user wants to access a specific/ private section of the page.
			</p>

			<p>Or think of JavaScript based online games, JavaScript code enables users to tell a game character (object) what to do and when. So by defining JavaScript objects and functions you create a pool of possible actions that a object will take in case of a certain event. An event can be a user entering a keyword, clicking on objects, moving objects etc. You'll find a good <strong>example</strong> of a client-side JavaScript based Solitaire game <a href="http://www.inmensia.com/files/solitaire1.0.html">here.</a></p>
			
			<p>Finally, as JavaScript makes web pages so much more interactive, I  - and I am sure most users - prefer to (re-)visit and stay on these dynamic pages. This also means that a company looking to hire a web developer, will most certainly give the job to the one with JavaScript skills.
