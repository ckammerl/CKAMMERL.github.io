			<h1>04/12/14 Problems the tech world is facing today</h1>
			<p>In my humble opinion, one of the biggest problems the tech world is facing today is <strong>security</strong>. It is actually not a new issue but a constant problem since we started using technology. Not only our smartphones and fancy online applications we use today have to be safe. Before we went online, our hair dryer, washer, car etc. had to be safe and secure too. The car manufacture had to build the car in a way that made it secure to drive but also prevented the car to be easily stolen.</p>
			<p>The interesting thing about security is that it is everybody's duty to address security issues. Not only the tech industry but you and me as user of the technology that 
			 the industry provides us with.</p> 
			 <p>As an example, when <span class="highlight">web developers</span> are writing applications today, their goal should be to provide users with a tool that not only has great usability, but which is stable and secure. The code has to be written that way, i.e. test should have been made constantly while developing, the code should be clean and well structured and known security issues should have been addressed. Such a code helps finding and eliminating bugs that might lead to drastic security issues today AND in the future. A developer's single aim should not be to create the eternally perfect, faultless software, but instead to write a clean and easy to read code that allows for easy and fast changes and updates if necessary. The developer can't know today what security challenges its program has to tackle in the future. But he/she can build the application in a way that makes it flexible and adjustible. That's the foundation for providing security now and in the future.</p>
			 <p>On the same time, it is also up to <span class="highlight">users</span> of a web application to check for available updates and to install necessary updates in time. Users also influence how well their data is protected by choosing complex passwords and not saving the password in a place that can easily be accessed or found. It is similar to not writing your bank account pin on a piece of paper and carrying that piece of paper in your wallet. Or not leaving your car open in a busy environement with the key in the ignition.</p>
