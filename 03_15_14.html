				<li><a href="http://www.cut-magazine.com">Cut Magazine</a></li>
				<img src="#"/>
				<li><a href="http://local.amazon.com">Amazon local</a></li>

			</ol>

			<p>Checkout the three websites listed above. These are some of my favorite sites in terms of design. 
				They all address different audiences and have different target groups and purposes.</p>
				
			<p><a href="http://www.cut-magazine.com">Cut Magazine</a> addresses the Do-it-Yourself community and 
				delves into every aspect of DYI - especially into fashion. <a href="http://local.amazon.com">Amazon local</a> is a shopping platform dedicated to advertise special offerings in your local area across almost 
				every category (entertainment, health/wellness, sport, travel etc.). And last but not least <a href="http://www.onemedical.com">One Medical Group</a> is a healthcare group established to improve access to 
				physicians in the Bay Area.</p>

			<p>Despite their different purposes, all three pages and platforms have their simple and clean design
			 in common. None of them is overloaded with content or distracting, oversized images and/or moving elements; 
			 key information is highlighted (color and/or font-size) and navigating through their pages and accessing the individual content is quiet easy.</p>
			 
			 <p>They are well structured and allow you to get the required information 
			 within 1-2 clicks. I am not saying these three web pages are perfect; there is room for improvement. Looking 
			 at the <a href="http://www.cut-magazine.com/blog/">Cut Magazine's blog</a> for instance, I would recommend 
			 adding additional hyperlinks and enlarging the blog posts' font-size to improve readability.</p>
