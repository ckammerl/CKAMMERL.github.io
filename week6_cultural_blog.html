			<h1>04/18/14 Stereotypes</h1>
			<p>I am glad that I have not experienced a situation in which I felt that negative stereotyping dramatically impacted the outcome of my work or led me to decisions that I regretted afterwards. Of course, I am completely aware of specific stereotypes and as a woman, I especially sense <span class="highlight">women-related stereotyping.</span></p>
			<p>Thinking back to school, I sensed I am part of the group that is supposed to be great at literature and art, but not in math. It is a part of our society to be socialised in a certain way. As a result, we think to have <em>knowledge</em> about how certain things are structured (and have to be), like <strong>boys like blue and play with cars</strong> and <strong>girls like pink and play with dolls</strong>.</p>

			<p>At school you face the gender stereotype again: <strong>boys are better in math than girls are</strong>. It is a negative stereotype but I remember some less successful tests were thinking of this stereotype gave me some comfort and kept me from being too upset: I just told myself something like <em>'this is not the end of the world and besides, being a girl, people do not expect you to be perfect in math'</em>. To be honest, this gave me comfort in the first place but after a short while, feeling a stereotype apply (I stereotyped myself..) also made me stubborn and fight even more to prove the opposite.</p> 

			<p>Another moment I felt being stereotyped was a visit at a hair cutter shortly after I moved to the US. My hair is cut short, nothing specially meaningful in Germany. But based on what the hair cutter chatted I learned that girls with short hair are not as common in the US and some people link short hair to being homosexual. I felt a irritated. Not because I felt uncomfortable with being counted into that group, but because I felt misjudged and 'rated' by the society without any personal knowledge of myself.</p> 

			<p>That feeling wasn't good and first I felt a little bit <span class="highlight">'watched' and certainly misunderstood</span>. But my anger about such a stereotyped-thinking of some people was bigger than being upset about it. That helped me to get over it quickly, to continue having short hair and not to bother. I have to admit that a feeling that being stereotyped in this way does not happen too often, especially not in the cities I live(d), helped me to ignore it.</p>

			<p>And what would I do if I suspected a colleague to feel a stereotype threat? I would not address him or her directly and ask whether my suspicsion is true. I don't think that would do any good as my asking could be wrongly (negatively) interpreted . But in a conversation, I would address possible stereotype fears by highlighting what the basis for this conversation is and starting with positive feedback. The most important thing is to really know what you want the other person to give feedback about. And then I would do the best I could to give him/her the feeling of <span class="highlight">being in a friendly and constructive environment</span>.</p>
