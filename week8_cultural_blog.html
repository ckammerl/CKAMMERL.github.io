			<h1>05/02/14 Chefs in the Kitchen</h1>
			<p>I felt inspired by Shereef's chat and how he answered students' questions. I loved how he used analogies like learning a mucic instrument to describe the process of going through the different phases. DBC for me is a friendly, open and supportive space and environement. I like how DBC emphasizes the team spirit and encourages everyone to share, ideas, passion as well as fears of being intimitated by not knowing things and of possible excessive demands. The power to be a successful cohort however is on us students and I hope that we grow together fast and we manage to keep up seing our cohort success as personal sucess.</p> 
			<p>The chat also sets the right perspective in terms of the work load we can expect. Our time at DBC will be very tough. I know I will be angry about myself and things that might happen, very tired, anxious about my personal development and skill improvement etc. I am a introverted person and as Shereef said, pairing and constantly working closely together with people is energy draining for me and I am sure there will be moments when I need some time alone. At the same time, working in good teams is more fun and laughing with each other reduces so much negative energy. So I hope I can contribute to our team by being open, calm and structured in my work. And to support a good atmosphere by loving to laugh and being happily ready to join you for a drink after a long day.</p>
