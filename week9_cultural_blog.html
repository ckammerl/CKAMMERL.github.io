			<h1>05/09/14 Thinking styles</h1>
			<p>Looking at the <a href="">Gregorian thinking styles</a>, I see a mix of all of them but mainly 'abstract sequential' and 'abstract random' thinking fitting best for me. Stimulating environments and maintaining friendly relationships are important and I know I am growing the most when I have the opportunity to work and learn with others - class mates and instructors. Harmony is therefore important.</p>
			<p> At the same time, I am analyzing situations before making a decision and this also requires the opportunity to be/ work alone from time to time. In order to succeed at DBC I'll try to remember why I chose to this path and to remember my goals. I am doing this for me and it is a great chance, a unique opportunity to learn, grow and think differently. DBC is providing the place to achieve it and I will be working with fantastic class mates. We are all facing the same fears. I hope I won't be stuck in bad moments but will be able to remember my motivation that brought me here. And furthermore to identify the source of negative feelings by reflecting my own behaviour, my way of thinking which will at the end also help me understand my colleagues.<p>
