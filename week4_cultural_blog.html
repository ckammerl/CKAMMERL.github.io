			<h1>04/05/14 Don't be resentful</h1>
			<p>Usually, if I feel that something is not feeling right, that somebody might have gotten something wrong I did or said or that I am upset of an action of somebody else, I am asking the person to meet as soon as possible and ask him or her if what I sensed is true. If yes, I am talking about it with him or her. Being in a calm environment when discussing always helps. I try not to confront nor to accuse my counterpart but to start a good and reasonable discussion. In my opinion, the best way to solve an emotional conflict is to talk in person. I want to understand the other person's thoughts, the intention when he or she did something that troubled me. And I do the same, I share my thoughts and feelings with that person. The solution should be found by collaboration and compromises made by both sides.</p> 

			<p>That should always be possible, you only need to be open. Depending on the conflict's topic, I am sometimes the person who makes more and sometimes the person who does less compromises. But there's a "middle" where we can meet and both parties feel good with. I am not saying finding and doing compromises is easy nor is reaching an agreement. It can take some time but luckily until now, at some point I was able to solve emotional conflicts and to find a solution that satisified both parties.</p>

			<p>What really helps me is the fact that I am not resentful. After we settle a conflict, it is and will be settled for me. I have the great talent to forget about what we quarreled about because we settled it and it is not longer important/ existing. That might sounds odd and maybe also like I don't care much, but it's the opposite. I love harmony and I don't want to stay in the state of a conflict and having the feeling that something is/ might be wrong. That's why I address it as soon as I can, i.e. after I reflected and know what I actually want to address in the discussion. And after we solved that issue, we are friends, family, co-workers or whatever again. Back to zero. If that person would ask me if I remember what the conflict was about a couple of months later, it would take me some time to remember. Not because I don't care, but because I move on and it doesn't matter what it was.</p>

			<p>The relationship to that person might have changed since the last conflict, but in a way that should be acceptable and good for both sides. Therefore we can continue together but at the same time, we started over the moment we solved the issue because we don't bring old conflicts with us.</p>
