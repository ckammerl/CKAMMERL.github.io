			<h1>03/21/14 - Exploring my values</h1>
			<h2>In times in your life where you've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</h2>
			<p><span class="highlight">Accomplishment</span> Accountability Achievement <span class="highlight">Activism Adventure </span>Affection Ambition Autonomy <span class="highlight">Challenge Close relationships</span> Commitment Community Compassion Competence Competition Confidence Conformity <span class="highlight">Control</span> Coolness under fire Cooperation <span class="highlight">Courage Creativity Credibility</span> Decisiveness Economic security Effectiveness <span class="highlight">Efficiency</span> Enthusiasm Environmentalism Excellence Excitement Fairness Faith Fame <span class="highlight">Free time</span> Freedom Friendships Growth Having a family <span class="highlight">Health Helping other people</span> Helping society Honesty Hospitality Independence Influence <span class="highlight">Inner harmony</span> Insight Inspiration Integrity Intellectual status Introspection Justice <span class="highlight">Knowledge</span> Leadership Location <span class="highlight">Loyalty Meaningful work Mentorship</span> Merit <span class="highlight">Money</span> Movement <span class="highlight">Music</span> Nature Openness Order Patriotism Peace Persistance Personal development Physical challenge Pleasure Power and authority Privacy Public service Purity Quality <span class="highlight">Recognition</span> Reputation <span class="highlight">Responsibility</span> Romance Security Self-knowledge Self-reliance Self-respect Serenity Sophistication Spirituality Stability Status Tranquility Truth Vibrancy Volunteering Wealth Will-power Wisdom</p>

			<h2>Pick one and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.</h2>
			
			<p>I find it difficult to pick just one of the values above and to explain why it's important to me. I believe that they are heavily related and appear as a mix when I'm happy and satisfied. But to break it down, I think one of the most important values is <span class="highlight">free time</span>. This might now look like I am a lazy person but for me, free time is something that helps me reach my goals - at work and in private live.</p> 

			<p>I would say having a couple of minutes/ hours just for me, is my greatest value because it's me deciding what to do and when and with whome. At work, only 5 minutes of freetime is the option to step back and to free yourself when you're stuck. Free time helps me to achieve the states that are bound to the other values I highlighted. Like having <span class="highlight">time </span><strong>to be adventurous, to be creative, to be reflective and credible, to be with my closest friends and family, to listen to music etc</strong>.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>In general, I try to live up to these values:</h2>
			<p>Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 <span class="highlight">-----4</span> ----- 5 Agree</p>
			<br>	
			<h2>What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?</h2>
			<p>How would you decide:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Stay in your favorite city but start over as a freelancer</li>
				<li>Move to a foreign city and stay in your job</li>
			</ul>
