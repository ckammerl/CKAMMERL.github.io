			<h1>03/28/14 Pairing and Feedback</h1>
			<p><strong>Pairing</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Pairing with others to solve challenges makes the task more fun. I really enjoy the discussions we have and the ambition to find the right code solution as a team.</li><br>
				<li>Switching from driver to navigator and back improves my skill to express myself with the correct technical terms and to deepen my knowledge about the material I studied by describing it to my partner. Of course, it's fantastic  if you get out of a pairing session with new technical skills.</li><br>
				<li>I technically most benefitted of pairing sessions with class-mates who were at the same or at a higher technical level than myself. However, it's always great if you can help your partner understand a concept better! These sessions were great exercises to learn how to express myself more clearly.</li><br>
			</ul>


			<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>I felt the feedback was honest and kind. It mostly reflected what I also felt of my part during the session.</li><br>
				<li>The feedback was helpful as it underlined a fact that I know I'am struggling with: expressing myself clearly and slowing down when explaining a concept. It would have been great if some of the feedback would have been a bit more concrete and actionable, though.</li><br>
				<li>Next time I pair, I'll briefly discuss the actions with the pair at the beginning to make sure we're both on the same page; being more precise in telling my partner at what part/ line of code I am looking at; but most important, I will try to express myself more clearly, speak slowly and check in with my partner more often to confirm he understood my idea.</li><br>
				<li>Writing feedback wasn't too difficult nor too time consuming.</li><br>
				<li>What I found most difficult when writing feedback for my pair was to keep the balance between being kind but writing specific and actionable feedback that my partner understands the "right" way, i.e. not as criticism.</li>
			</ul>

			<br>

			<p><span class="highlight">Overall</span> I think using pairing and feedback to guide my learning make sense and I am profitting of both. However, I am glad that our learning is a mix of pairing, solo, group sessions and challenges because that allows me to learn in different scenarios and to get the best out of each of them. </p>
