			<h1>04/25/14 Staying positive</h1>
			<p>Looking back at the identified values in my blog post <a href="03_21_14.html">About Values</a> I think that especially <span class="highlight">'Control', 'Credability', 'Inner Harmony' and 'Recognition'</span> can be impacted in a stereotyped environment. In another blog post called <a href="week6_cultural_blog.html">About Stereotypes</a>, I linked being stereotyped to the feeling of 'being watched and mistunderstood'. There is certainly a direct connection between these feelings and the level of how I see important values being respected. Threats like stereotypes impact my inner harmony and that in turn impacts my mood, behaviour/ productivity and how affirmated I feel.</p>

			<p>On the other hand, valueing <span class="highlight">'Responsibility', 'Courage' and 'Helping others'</span> will hopefully help me see and mediate stereotype threat.</p>

			<p>I strongly believe that DBC creates an open environment and encourages students to talk. This includes pair programming, exchanging ideas as well as sharing feelings like we do in our cultural blog posts. The environment is competitive and we are a bunch of highly motivated and intelligent people. But what I've experienced so far is that our group is not a group of solo ignorant fighters but everybody is appreciating giving and receiving feedback and helping other students by sharing knowledge. This feeling will make it easier for me at times when I feel down because I know that <strong>asking questions is welcome</strong> and <strong>addressing feelings is encouraged</strong>!</p>

			<p>Being more active and forcing myself to exercise more and to go to yoga classes will help me to relax and calm down and therefore to sleep better and not to get caught in frustration.</p>
